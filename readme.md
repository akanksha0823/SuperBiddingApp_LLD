Design a bidding app with below requirements:

A company SuperBidder has hosted an Online Auction System where any user(seller) can sell an object through an auction. Each auction has a lowest bid limit and the highest bid limit. Any registered user(buyer) can participate in an auction and bid on the product. Buyers can update this bid amount or withdraw from an auction until the auction is completed. When the auction closes, show the winning bid using the highest unique bid. The program should take as input two or more auctions and a set of users participating in these. Multiple auctions can happen simultaneously. A new requirement came in where SuperBidder has requested that they want to decide the winner based on the lowest unique bid as well. Accommodate this change as well.
